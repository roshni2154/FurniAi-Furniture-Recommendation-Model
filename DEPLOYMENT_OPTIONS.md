# Monorepo Deployment Guide

## üîÑ Deploy Frontend + Backend Together (Monorepo)

If you want **one URL** for both frontend and backend, follow these steps:

### Current Situation:
- ‚úÖ Backend already deployed at: `https://furniture-recommendation-model-ai-3a8c-al6n6fqp6.vercel.app`

### Two Approaches:

---

## Approach 1: Keep Separate Deployments (Recommended) ‚≠ê

**This is the standard approach and what I recommend.**

### What you have now:
- Backend: `https://furniture-recommendation-model-ai-3a8c-al6n6fqp6.vercel.app`

### What to do:
1. Go to https://vercel.com/new
2. Import **same repository** again
3. Set **Root Directory**: `frontend`
4. Add environment variable:
   - `VITE_API_URL`: `https://furniture-recommendation-model-ai-3a8c-al6n6fqp6.vercel.app`
5. Deploy

### Result:
- Backend: `https://furniture-recommendation-model-ai-3a8c-al6n6fqp6.vercel.app` (existing)
- Frontend: `https://furniture-recommendation-frontend.vercel.app` (new)

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ Both services independent
- ‚úÖ Can update frontend without touching backend
- ‚úÖ Better performance
- ‚úÖ Easier to manage

## Approach 2: Redeploy as Single Project (Monorepo)

**If you want ONE URL for everything.**

### Step 1: Delete Current Backend Deployment

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Select your backend project: `furniture-recommendation-model-ai-3a8c`
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **General**
4. Scroll down and click **"Delete Project"**

### Step 2: Deploy from Root

1. Go to https://vercel.com/new
2. Import repository: `bhatiashaurya/FurnitureRecommendation-Model-AI`
3. **Important**: Leave **Root Directory** as `.` (root, not frontend or backend)
4. Framework: Select **"Other"**
5. Build settings:
   - Build Command: `cd frontend && npm install && npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `frontend/dist`
6. Deploy

### Step 3: Access Your App

After deployment, you'll have ONE URL:
- Frontend: `https://your-app.vercel.app/`
- Backend API: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/recommend`
- Analytics: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/analytics`

### Configuration Files Updated:
- ‚úÖ `vercel.json` (root) - Routes configured for monorepo
- ‚úÖ Both backend and frontend in one deployment

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ Single URL for everything
- ‚úÖ Simpler to share (one link)

**Disadvantages:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Larger deployment
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Must redeploy both if either changes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Backend limitations still apply

## üéØ My Recommendation

**Use Approach 1 (Separate Deployments)** because:

1. ‚úÖ Your backend is already deployed and working
2. ‚úÖ No need to delete and redeploy
3. ‚úÖ Standard industry practice
4. ‚úÖ Better scalability
5. ‚úÖ Can update frontend independently

Just deploy the frontend as a **new project** pointing to your existing backend!

## üöÄ Quick Decision Guide

### Choose Separate Deployments if:
- You want to keep existing backend deployment
- You want flexibility to update independently
- You want best performance
- **This is what I recommend!**

### Choose Monorepo if:
- You want ONE single URL
- You don't mind redeploying both together
- You're okay with deleting current backend

## What Should You Do?

**I recommend Approach 1.** Just tell me:

**"Deploy frontend separately"** ‚Üí I'll guide you through deploying frontend as new project

**"Redeploy as monorepo"** ‚Üí I'll help you delete backend and redeploy everything together
